# Speedify
A Chrome Extension for speeding up (or slowing down) HTML5 video playback.

After struggling to pay attention during painfully slow online lectures (thanks, COVID-19), I decided to take matters into my own hands and created Speedify. With this extension any HTML5 video can be played back at a custom speed, making boring lecture videos fly by.
